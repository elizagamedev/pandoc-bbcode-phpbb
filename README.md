# pandoc-bbcode-phpbb

## Introduction

This is a modified Lua script to write phpBB's subset of BBCode via
[pandoc][link:pandoc] based on the [original pandoc-bbcode][link:pandoc-bbcode]
and [pandoc-bbcode-phpbb][link:pandoc-bbcode-phpbb]. The aim is to be able to
output BBCode as perfectly formatted as possible with the result not necessarily
being human-readable.

You can view this readme's autogenerated BBCode [here][link:bbcode].

This script can be used used with Pandoc in the following way:

    pandoc -t pandoc-bbcode-phpbb.lua -o $output $input

## Markdown Demonstration

### Text emphasis

_Simple emphasis_, __strong emphasis__

### Quoting

Quotes without attribution:

> This is a quotation with no author specified.

Quotes with attribution:

> @Username: This text was written by "Username"

Though not standard in phpBB, you can also use `@spoiler` to generate a spoiler
block:

> @spoiler
> It was Earth all along!

### Footnotes

We can now do footnotes[^1]. They will be put at the very end of the
post!

[^1]: You see, this is how footnotes work! But BBCode still sucks.

### Tables

BBCode doesn't render tables, nor allows it raw HTML tags. The only
solution for rendering thus is rendering them as ASCII tables, but it gets the
job done.

| Heading 1 | Heading 2        | Heading 3 |
| --------- |:----------------:| ---------:|
| left      | centered         |     right |
| groovy    | this is text     |   radical |
| Unicod€   | Slagsmålsklubben |    Piñata |

within `[code]` tags.

### Miscellaneous Features

These features either aren't part of standard installations of phpBB or have
no 1:1 implementation otherwise.

* `inline code`
